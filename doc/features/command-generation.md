![Generate and copy commands](../copy-command.gif)

Some types of requests allow copying as shell commands. Click the dropdown menu near the "Send" or "Connect" button, and the copy buttons are there.

Supported operations are as follows:

| Request                      | Copying as verbose cURL commands | Copying as verbose [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) commands | Copying as PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command (for Windows pwsh.exe) |
